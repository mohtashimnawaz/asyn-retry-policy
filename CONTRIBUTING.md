Contributing
============

Thanks for your interest! Please follow these guidelines:

- Open an issue for bugs or feature requests.
- Fork and open a PR for changes. Keep changes small and focused.
- Run `cargo test` and `cargo fmt` before submitting.
- Document notable behavior in README or `src/lib.rs` docs.
- Use `rng_seed` in tests that rely on jitter to ensure determinism.
